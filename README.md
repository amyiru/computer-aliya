# Apple Macintosh

# Debut
The Macintosh, often referred to as the Mac, made its debut on January 24, 1984. The launch event took place at Apple's annual shareholder meeting in Cupertino, California. This iconic moment in computing history was marked by the unveiling of the Macintosh personal computer by Apple co-founder Steve Jobs.


# Processor type

Processor Type: Motorola 68000

Processor Speed: 8 MHz

The Motorola 68000 was a 16/32-bit microprocessor and was chosen for its capabilities in handling the graphical user interface and other features of the Macintosh operating system. The clock speed of 8 MHz was considered decent for that era and contributed to the Macintosh's performance in running the graphical interface and applications of the time. Keep in mind that these specifications reflect the technology available in the early 1980s and are significantly different from today's processors.

# RAM (Memory)

The original Macintosh, released in 1984, came with 128 kilobytes (KB) of RAM. Yes, kilobytes, not megabytes or gigabytes. This was a modest amount of memory even for its time, but the Macintosh's innovative graphical user interface and design made it stand out in the computing landscape. Keep in mind that computing technology has evolved significantly since then, and today's devices have vastly more memory and processing power.

# Graphics Card (GPU)


The original Macintosh, released in 1984, did not have a dedicated Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) in the modern sense. Instead, the graphical capabilities were largely handled by the main processor, the Motorola 68000. The Macintosh used a bitmapped display and relied on the processor for rendering graphics and managing the graphical user interface.

During this time, the concept of a separate GPU as we understand it today was not prevalent, and graphics processing was integrated into the overall system architecture. Dedicated GPUs with specialized functions for graphics rendering became more common in later years as graphical demands increased with advancements in software and user interfaces.
